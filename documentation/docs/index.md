## Overview

This is a sample documentation site developed using the [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach. The [source code](https://github.com/Iurii132/sample-doc-site/tree/main/documentation) is built into HTML using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and published to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) through a GitHub Actions [workflow](https://github.com/Iurii132/sample-doc-site/actions/workflows/pages-deploy.yml).

The documentation explains the [server.js](https://github.com/Iurii132/sample-doc-site/blob/main/application/server.js) application, which is a tiny example Node.js Express server.


## Purpose

- Provide a sample end-to-end documentation workflow.
- Showcase markdown functionality.
- Practice with API documentation.
- Explore AI capabilities to write documentation.
